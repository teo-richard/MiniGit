Project inspired by UCB's CS61B Gitlet. The reason I started this project is because Git and GitHub genuinely confuse me so I figured building a mini version of Git would help me understand what the heck is happening under the hood.

`notes.ipynb` are my personal notes on topics I had to learn and/or struggled with. These 
notes are perpetually in-progress until the project is finished.

This `README.md` file will be updated as I progress throughout the project.  

So far, I have implemented (or at least I think I have...) init, staging, commit, status, log, and commit checkout functions. They work fine, but I have not yet tested in-depth for edge cases. Some of the main functions I have yet to implement are branch checkout, edit commit, delete commit, add branch, and merge functions.
