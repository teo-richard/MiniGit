Project inspired by UCB's CS61B Gitlet. This project is in the very early stages and due to 
me having a life, progress will be slow but hopefully steady. The reason I started this project is because Git and GitHub genuinely confuse me so I figured building a mini version of Git would help me understand what the heck is happening under the hood.

`notes.ipynb` are my personal notes on topics I had to learn and/or struggled with. These 
notes are perpetually in-progress until the project is finished.

This `README.md` file will be updated as I progress throughout the project.
