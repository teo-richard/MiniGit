    "## Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW ABOUT HASH TABLES**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you glean one thing from this, know: **hash tables are good because they generally have a constant lookup time.** i.e. no matter how big the list is, the time to get an index (which will get you the value of a key) is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hash tables are different from cryptographic hashes like SHA-1*\n",
    "\n",
    "What are hashes? A hash is number that you get after putting a key into a hash function. The number is an idex. THe purpose is for fast lookups: isntead of searching through a whole row in an array, just jump to the correct spot.\n",
    "- In this example I use hashes like 829 as an example but normally they're long, like `ef92b778bafe771e89245b89ecbc08a44a4e166c06659911881f383d4473e94f`\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I hash key-value pairs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have an array with key-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Key** | \"b\" | \"a\" | \"c\" |\n",
    "| - | - | - | - | \n",
    "| **Value** | \"banana\" | \"apple\" | \"cantaloupe\" | \n",
    "\n",
    "You see \"a\" has index 0 and index 0 of **Value** corresponds to \"apple\", and so forth for the other **Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1** \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a hash table (a really big array)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert the **Keys** to bytes, i.e. **serialize** it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put the byte representatino of the **Keys** into a hash function that spits out a number\n",
    "- Hash functions spit out numbers that are irreversible (you can't know what they key is given the hash function output) and independent of the other outputs (one output doesn't give you information about the other outputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each output from the hash function is an **index**. For example, if \"b\" goes into the function and the output is 489, then \"banana\" will be stored at index 489 of the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Index** | ... | 489 | ... |\n",
    "| - | - | - | - | \n",
    "| **Value** | ... | \"banana\" | ... | \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can quickly look up the value for a key! If you want the value for \"b\", put \"b\" into the hash function, i.e. hash(\"b\") = 489 and then look for index 489 in your table and you will find \"banana.\" (where you are actually putting bytes into the hash function)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "What if two inputs (two keys) hash to the same output (same index)? E.g. hash(\"a\") = 892 and hash(\"b\") = 892.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can chain, which means store multiple items at the same index, i.e. the 892nd index in your table contains a list `[\"apple\", \"banana\"]`. Often you want some amount of chaining because this helps reduce your table size and saves memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "So yes you should minimize collisions in your hashing, but strategic collisions can be good because it reduces memory useage. "

    "\n",
    "Instead of finding where to store data, crypotgraphic hashes are used to create an unforgeable fingerprint of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a user create a password `\"secretPass\"` and we run a hash algorithm and get a hash `\"abc123\"`. (Not sure how our algorithm got us that but don't worry about it...)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our database, instead of storing `\"secretPass\"`, we store the hash, `\"abc123\"`. We then forget about the password `\"secretPass\"`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, if hackers steal the database, they only get hashes which doesn't do anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "For cryptographic hashes, hash functions **must be**:\n",
